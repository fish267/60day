## 1. [Not all but sometimes all](http://www.codewars.com/kata/564ab935de55a747d7000040/train/python)

Write

    remove(text, what)

that takes in a string str(text in Python) and an object/hash/dict what and returns a string with the chars removed in what. For example:

    remove('this is a string',{'t':1, 'i':2}) == 'hs s a string'
    # remove from 'this is a string' the first 1 't' and the first 2 i's.
    remove('hello world',{'x':5, 'i':2}) == 'hello world'
    # there are no x's or i's, so nothing gets removed
    remove('apples and bananas',{'a':50, 'n':1}) == 'pples d bnns'
    # we don't have 50 a's, so just remove it till we hit end of string.

### check

## 2. [Group in 10s](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5694d22eb15d78fe8d00003a/train/python)

Write a function groupIn10s which takes any number of arguments, and groups them into sets of 10s and sorts each group in ascending order.

The return value should be an array of arrays, so that numbers between 0-9 inclusive are in position 0 and numbers 10-19 are in position 1, etc.

Here's an example of the required output:

    grouped = group_in_10s(8, 12, 38, 3, 17, 19, 25, 35, 50) 

    grouped[0]     # [3, 8]
    grouped[1]     # [12, 17, 19]
    grouped[2]     # [25]
    grouped[3]     # [35, 38]
    grouped[4]     # None
    grouped[5]     # [50]

## 3. [Complementary DNA](http://www.codewars.com/kata/554e4a2f232cdd87d9000038/train/python)

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

    DNA_strand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"

    DNA_strand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"

    
### Solution

```python

map = {'T': 'A', 'A': 'T', 'C': 'G', 'G': 'C'}
def DNA_strand(dna):
    return ''.join([map[x] for x in dna])

```

使用文档说明

    reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value

    Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.
    For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5). 
    If initial is present, it is placed before the items of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the sequence is empty.

```python

def f(x, y):
    return x + y

print(reduce(f, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4]))

# 输出 10
```



# Solution

```python
def chained(functions):
    def inner(param):
        for function in functions:
            param = function(param)
        return param

    return inner
```

    get_sum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3
    get_sum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
    get_sum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
    get_sum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1
    get_sum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2

# 7. [Looking for a benefactor](http://www.codewars.com/kata/569b5cec755dd3534d00000f/train/python)

The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: <code>[14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]</code> He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he made a mistake. Could you help him?

    if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149

The function new_avg(arr, newavg) should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average newavg. Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us to throw an error (return Nothing in Haskell) so that he clearly sees that his expectations are not great enough.

Notes:

- all donations are numbers, arr can be empty.
- See examples below to see which error is to be thrown.

    new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 92) should return 645
    new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 2) should raise ValueError

# 9. [Validate Credit Card Number](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5418a1dd6d8216e18a0012b2/train/python)

In this Kata, you will implement The [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm), which is used to help validate credit card numbers.

Given a positive integer of up to 16 digits, return true if it is a valid credit card number, and false if it is not.

Here is the algorithm:

  If there are an even number of digits, double every other digit starting with the first, and if there are an odd number of digits, double every other digit starting with the second. Another way to think about it is, from the right to left, double every other digit starting with the second to last digit.

    1714 => [1*, 7, 1*, 4] => [2, 7, 2, 4]

    12345 => [1, 2*, 3, 4*, 5] => [1, 4, 3, 8, 5]

    891 => [8, 9*, 1] => [8, 18, 1]

  If a resulting doubled number is greater than 9, replace it with either the sum of it's own digits, or 9 subtracted from it.

     [8, 18*, 1] => [8, (1+8), 1] => [8, 9, 1]

   (or)

     [8, 18*, 1] => [8, (18-9), 1] => [8, 9, 1]

  Sum all of the final digits

     [8, 9, 1] => 8+9+1 => 18

  Finally, take that sum and divide it by 10. If the remainder equals zero, the original credit card number is valid.

     18 (modulus) 10 => 8.  

     8 does not equal 0, so 891 is not a valid credit card number.

aesar Ciphers are one of the most basic forms of encryption. It consists of a message and a key, and it shifts the letters of the message for the value of the key.

Your task is to create a function encryptor that takes 2 arguments - key and message - and returns the encrypted message.

    A message 'Caesar Cipher' and a key of 1 returns 'Dbftbs Djqifs'.

    A message 'Caesar Cipher' and a key of -1 returns 'Bzdrzq Bhogdq'.

Make sure to only shift letters, and be sure to keep the cases of the letters the same. All punctuation, numbers, spaces, and so on should remain the same.

Also be aware of keys greater than 26 and less than -26. There's only 26 letters in the alphabet!

# 11.[Triangle number check](http://www.codewars.com/kata/557e8a141ca1f4caa70000a6/train/python)

Description:

A triangle number is a number where n objects form an equilateral triangle (it's a bit hard to explain). For example, 6 is a triangle number because you can arrange 6 objects into an equilateral triangle:
<pre>
      1
     2 3
    4 5 6

</pre>
8 is not a triangle number because 8 objects do not form an equilateral triangle:

<pre>
   1
  2 3
 4 5 6
7 8

</pre>
In other words, the nth triangle number is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n.
Your task:

Check if a given input is a valid triangle number. Return true if it is, false if it is not (note that any non-integers, including non-number types, are not triangle numbers).

You are encouraged to develop an effective algorithm: test cases include really big numbers.
Assumptions:

You may assume that the given input, if it is a number, is always positive.
Notes:

0 and 1 are triangle numbers.

# 13. [Wind component calculation](http://www.codewars.com/kata/542c1a6b25808b0e2600017c/train/python)

When landing an airplane manually, the pilot knows which runway he is using and usually has up to date wind information (speed and direction). This information alone does not help the pilot make a safe landing; what the pilot really needs to know is the speed of headwind, how much crosswind there is and from which side the crosswind is blowing relative to the plane.

Let's imagine there is a system in the ATC tower with speech recognition that works so that when a pilot says "wind info" over the comms, the system will respond with a helpful message about the wind.

Your task is to write a function that produces the response before it is fed into the text-to-speech engine.

Input:

- runway (string: "NN[L/C/R]"). NN is the runway's heading in tens of degrees. A suffix of L, C or R may be present and should be ignored. NN is between 01 and 36.
- wind_direction (int). Direction wind is blowing from in degrees. Between 0 and 359.
- wind_speed (int). Wind speed in knots

Output:

    a string in the following format: "(Head|Tail)wind N knots. Crosswind N knots from your (left|right)."

The wind speeds must be correctly rounded integers. If the rounded headwind component is 0, "Head" should be used. Similarly, "right" in case crosswind component is 0.

Calculating crosswind and headwind:

    A = Angle of the wind from the direction of travel (radians)
    WS = Wind speed
    CW = Crosswind
    HW = Headwind

    CW = sin(A) * WS
    HW = cos(A) * WS

# 15. [Tube strike options calculator](http://www.codewars.com/kata/568ade64cfd7a55d9300003e/train/python)

<b>Tube strike options calculator</b>

*The sweaty bus ride*

There is a tube strike today so instead of getting the London Underground home you have decided to take the bus. It's a hot day and you have been sitting on the bus for over an hour, but the bus is hardly moving. Your arm is sticking to the window and sweat drips off your nose as you try to read your neighbour's book when you say to yourself, "This is ridiculous. I could have walked faster than this!" Suddenly you have an idea for an app that helps people decide whether to walk or take the bus home when the London Underground is on strike.

You rush home (relatively speaking) and begin to define the function that will underpin your app.

<b>Function specification</b>

You must create a function which takes three parameters; walking distance home, distance the bus must travel, and the combined distance of walking from the office to the bus stop and from the bus stop to your house. All distances are in kilometres.

So for example, if your home is 5km away by foot, and the bus that takes you home travels 6km, but you have to walk 500 metres to the bus stop to catch it and 500 metres to your house once the bus arrives (i.e. 1km in total), which is faster, walking or taking the bus?

Example - Which of these is faster?:

    Start---Walk 5km--->End
    Start---Walk 500m---Bus 6km---Walk 500m--->End

Walking speed and bus driving speed have been given to you as two pre-loaded constants.

    walk = 5 (km/hr) bus = 8 (km/hr)

The function must return the fastest option, either "Walk" or "Bus". If the walk is going to be over 2 hours, the function should recommend that you take the bus. If the walk is going to be under 10 minutes, the function should recommend that you walk.

Update - If both options are going to take the same amount of time, the function should recommend that you walk.

# 17. [Common Denominators](http://www.codewars.com/kata/54d7660d2daf68c619000d95/train/python)

Common denominators

You will have a list of rationals in the form

    [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... [numer_n, denom_n] ]
where all numbers are positive ints.

You have to produce a result in the form

    [ [N_1, D] ... [N_n, D] ]
in which D is as small as possible and

    N_1/D == numer_1/denom_1 ... N_n/D == numer_n,/denom_n.
Example :

    [ [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4] ] produces the array [ [6,12], [4,12], [3,12] ]

# 18.[When Sigma1 Function Has Equals Values For an Integer and Its Reversed One](http://www.codewars.com/kata/when-sigma1-function-has-equals-values-for-an-integer-and-its-reversed-one)

Description:

The function sigma 1, σ1 in mathematics, is known as the one that gives the sum of the divisors of an integer number.

For example for the number 10,

    σ1(10) = 18 # because the divisors of 10 are: 1, 2, 5, 10

    σ1(10) = 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18

You can see the graph of this important function up to 250:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/PPn4EGC.jpg)

The number 528 and its reversed, 825 have equal value for the function σ1.

    σ1(528) = σ1(825)

    divisors of 528 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 22, 24, 33, 44, 48, 66, 88, 132, 176, 264 and 528

    the sum of the divisors of 528 is 1488

    divisors of 825 are: 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 25, 33, 55, 75, 165, 275 and 825

    the sum of the divisors of 825 is 1488

In fact 528 is the smallest non palindromic integer that has this property.

We need a function, equal_sigma1(), that may collect all the positive integers that fulfill the property described above.

The function receives an upper limit, nMax, will output the total sum of these numbers and its reversed while are less or equal nMax.

Let's see some cases:

    equal_sigma1(100) = 0 # There are no numbers.

    equal_sigma1(1000) = 1353 # 528 and its revesed 825 were found, 528 +  825 = 1353

    equal_sigma1(2000) = 4565 # There are four numbers_: 528 + 825 + 1561 + 1651 = 4565

    equal_sigma1(1600) = 2914 # Now we have three numbers: 528 + 825 + 1561 = 2914

    equal_sigma1(1561) = 2914

The palindromic numbers (like 88, 808, 929), numbers that are equal to its reversed should be discarded.

Happy coding!!

# 19. [Sum consecutives](http://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-consecutives) 

<h2>Description</h2>:

You are given a list/array which contains only integers (positive and negative). Your job is to sum only the numbers that are the same and consecutive. The result should be one list.

Extra credit if you solve it in one line. You can asume there is never an empty list/array and there will always be an integer.

Same meaning: 1 == 1

1 != -1

Examples:

    [1,4,4,4,0,4,3,3,1] # should return [1,12,0,4,6,1]

    """So as you can see sum of consecutives 1 is 1 
    sum of 3 consecutives 4 is 12 
    sum of 0... and sum of 2 
    consecutives 3 is 6 ..."""

    [1,1,7,7,3] # should return [2,14,3]
    [-5,-5,7,7,12,0] # should return [-10,14,12,0]
